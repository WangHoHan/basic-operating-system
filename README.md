# BASIC OPERATING SYSTEM

It was a group project for Operating Systems course at Poznan University of Technology. The main purpose of the project was to create a Linux-based simulation of operating system using C++ programming language. Our implementation of OS consists such modules as: 
- file and folder system, 
- interpreter, 
- locks and synchronization mechanisms, 
- pipelines, 
- processes management, 
- processor manager, 
- shell, 
- RAM memory, 
- virtual memory.

My part of the project was to handle the Memory Management using Paging.
